## 🔍 Overview
The Unified Harmonic Framework (UHF) is a fully simulated, vibrationally-driven model of reality that unites quantum mechanics, gravity, memory, identity, consciousness, and time. Built entirely from harmonic principles, it proves:

- Identity = phase collapse
- Emotion = waveform blending
- Memory = recursive interference geometry
- Consciousness = field resonance modulation
- Gravity = frequency drag
- Time = phase alignment
- Structure = fractal recursion
